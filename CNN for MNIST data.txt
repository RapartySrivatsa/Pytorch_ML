Let's break down the code step by step and explain its functionality, focusing on the line self.linear = nn.Linear(out_channels * 7 * 7, 10).

Code Explanation
1. GPU Availability Check
python
Copy code
DEVICE = 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu'
print(f'Using device: {DEVICE}')
This checks if a GPU is available via CUDA (NVIDIA's parallel computing architecture). If a GPU is available, it will use the GPU (denoted as 'cuda'), otherwise, it will use the CPU ('cpu').
2. CNN Model Definition (class CNN)
python
Copy code
class CNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels=1, out_channels=16, kernel_size=5, kernel_size_max_pool=2, stride=1, padding=2):
        super(CNN, self).__init__()
This class inherits from nn.Module, making it a PyTorch model.
The __init__ method defines the layers of the CNN.
in_channels=1: The input has 1 channel (grayscale image).
out_channels=16: The output has 16 channels after the first convolution.
kernel_size=5: The convolution kernel size is 5x5.
kernel_size_max_pool=2: Max pooling kernel size is 2x2.
stride=1: The stride for the convolution is 1.
padding=2: Padding of 2 pixels is added on each side.
3. First Convolutional Block (conv1)
python
Copy code
self.conv1 = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(in_channels=in_channels, out_channels=out_channels, kernel_size=kernel_size, stride=stride, padding=padding),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=kernel_size_max_pool)
)
nn.Conv2d: A 2D convolutional layer. It takes the input with in_channels (1 for grayscale) and applies a kernel of size kernel_size (5) with stride and padding as defined.
nn.ReLU(): The ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity to the network.
nn.MaxPool2d: Max pooling with a kernel_size of 2x2 reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width).
4. Second Convolutional Block (conv2)
python
Copy code
self.conv2 = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Conv2d(in_channels=out_channels, out_channels=out_channels, kernel_size=kernel_size, stride=stride, padding=padding),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.MaxPool2d(kernel_size=kernel_size_max_pool)
)
Similar to conv1, but here the input channels are out_channels (16 from the first block) and the output remains the same (16 channels).
5. Linear Layer
python
Copy code
self.linear = nn.Linear(out_channels * 7 * 7, 10)
This is the crucial line you are asking about. Let's break it down:
out_channels * 7 * 7: After the two convolutional blocks, the input image (28x28 for MNIST) is downsampled by the convolutions and pooling layers.
First block (conv1): A 5x5 kernel, stride 1, and padding 2 keeps the spatial dimensions of the input almost the same (28x28). After max pooling with kernel size 2, the dimensions are halved, resulting in 14x14.
Second block (conv2): After another 5x5 kernel, stride 1, and padding 2, the dimensions stay close to 14x14. Another max pooling with 2x2 kernel reduces the dimensions to 7x7.
The resulting feature map after the two convolutions and pooling operations has dimensions of 16 channels, each of size 7x7 (since out_channels=16 and the spatial size is reduced to 7x7).
The self.linear layer connects this 7x7x16 tensor to a 10-dimensional output (representing 10 classes in MNIST).
So, the input to the nn.Linear layer is a flattened vector of size out_channels * 7 * 7 (i.e., 16 * 7 * 7 = 784), and the output is a vector of size 10, corresponding to the number of classes (digits 0-9).
6. Forward Pass
python
Copy code
def forward(self, x):
    x = self.conv1(x)
    x = self.conv2(x)
    x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten for the linear layer
    output = self.linear(x)
    return output
x = self.conv1(x): Passes the input x through the first convolutional block.
x = self.conv2(x): Passes the result through the second convolutional block.
x.view(x.size(0), -1): This flattens the tensor from 4D (batch size, channels, height, width) to 2D (batch size, flattened features). The -1 lets PyTorch infer the size of the second dimension.
output = self.linear(x): Passes the flattened tensor through the linear layer to get the final output.
return output: The final output is returned, which has a shape of (batch_size, 10) corresponding to class probabilities for each input image.
7. MLP Model (For Comparison)
python
Copy code
class MLP(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(MLP, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)  # Flatten input image
        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)
The MLP model is a simple fully connected network that flattens the 28x28 image (784 pixels) and passes it through a few dense layers. The final layer has 10 neurons, representing the 10 class predictions.
8. Training and Evaluation
The training loop trains both the MLP and CNN models.
For each epoch, the model is trained on the training data, and then evaluated on the test data. The accuracy and loss are printed after each epoch.
9. Counting Trainable Parameters
python
Copy code
mlp_params_count = sum(p.numel() for p in mlp_model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
cnn_params_count = sum(p.numel() for p in cnn_model.parameters() if p.requires_grad)
print(f'Trainable parameters in MLP model: {mlp_params_count}')
print(f'Trainable parameters in CNN model: {cnn_params_count}')
This counts the number of parameters in each model (MLP and CNN) that are trainable (i.e., parameters that require gradients).
Summary of the Line self.linear = nn.Linear(out_channels * 7 * 7, 10)
out_channels * 7 * 7: This represents the flattened output from the final convolutional layer (16 channels of size 7x7).
10: The number of output classes (digits 0-9 for MNIST).
The linear layer: It connects the 784 features (16 * 7 * 7) to the 10 output classes, which is suitable for classification tasks. The number 784 is the result of the image being downsampled through convolutions and pooling, and itâ€™s the flattened feature vector size used as input to the fully connected layer.
